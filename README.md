Gravity Simulator (C++ & SFML)

This project is a simple yet interactive gravity simulator built using C++ and SFML.
The application visually demonstrates gravitational forces and particle interactions, allowing you to create and manipulate gravitational bodies and observe how particles interact with them in real-time.

Features:

  -Gravity Sources: Add or remove gravity sources dynamically using mouse clicks.

  -Particle Dynamics: Simulate realistic particle physics under the influence of gravitational attraction.

  -Visual Force Field: Toggleable grid visualization that shows gravitational forces at various points in space.

  -Collision Handling: Particles detect and respond realistically upon collision with each other.
  


Interactive Controls:

  -Left-click: Add a new gravity source.

  -Middle-click: Add a particle.

  -Right-click: Remove the nearest gravity source.

  -G Key: Toggle gravity grid visualization.

  -ESC Key: Exit the simulation.
